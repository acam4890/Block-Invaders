# Block-Invaders
A minamalist version of Space Invaders with just rectangular blocks as opposed to colorful sprites. The enemies don't shoot back but they do move down the screen with every second bounce against the borders of the screen. If any "alien blocks" reach reach the player's "ship block" at bottom of the screen, the player loses. The laser/rocket for the player is visibly attached to player ship when ready to be fired and detaches when fired. The laser/rocket is reloaded when it has hit an alien ship or has been shot off screen. This was a fun project for a FPGA/Verilog HDL course.
